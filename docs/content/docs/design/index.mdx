## Introduction

This project is a modular, service-oriented communication platform that brings
together chat, media, and authentication into a cohesive, reliable ecosystem.
It is designed to be extensible, privacy-respecting, and developer-friendly,
attempting to be a modern foundation for real-time group communication services.

At its core, the system aims to balance simplicity and scalability: a clean 
architecture that can run as a single instance for small communities, yet scale 
horizontally and adopt distributed patterns as usage grows. Though I don't have
that much hope for how successful it would end up being at this.

## Vision and Goals

Our primary goal is to build a self-contained, modular chat system that is:

- **Composable**: Each service (Auth, Chat, Media) can run independently or as
  part of a unified deployment.
- **Secure**: Strong authentication, scoped authorization, and modern
  cryptographic practices are built in from day one.
- **Transparent**: APIs follow open standards (OAuth2, OpenID Connect-style
  JWT claims) and are documented with OpenAPI/Swagger.
- **Developer-centric**: Easy to reason about, easy to deploy, and
  straightforward to extend, whether you are building a frontend client, a
  bot, or a new service.

This design deliberately focuses on developer clarity over premature scaling. 
Each subsystem should stand alone, use explicit data boundaries, and 
communicate over clearly defined APIs or events.

## Architectural Overview

The platform is composed of several cooperating services:


import { 
    LockIcon, 
    Disc3Icon, 
    MessageSquareTextIcon, 
    TerminalIcon 
} from 'lucide-react';

<Cards>
    <Card title="Authentication Service" icon={<LockIcon />} href="/docs/auth">
        Handles identity and authorization with OAuth2-style tokens, scopes, and
        JWKS-based validation.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Chat Service" icon={<MessageSquareTextIcon />}>
        Provides persistent messaging, channels, and presence. Built for 
        consistency first, extensibility second.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Media Service" icon={<Disc3Icon />}>
        Handles media upload, storage, and retrieval with token-based access 
        control.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Frontend Clients" icon={<TerminalIcon />}>
        Web, desktop, or mobile interfaces that communicate through the service 
        APIs with real-time updates via WebSockets.
    </Card>
</Cards>


### Summary

This project's design is about building a foundation: not just a chat server,
but a system of composable services that can evolve into a full-featured
communication platform. Mainly so I can also just pilfer it for other projects.
Each service is autonomous, reliable, and adheres to open standards, making it
possible to deploy small, scale big, and integrate safely.
